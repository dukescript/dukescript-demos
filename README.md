# DukeScript Demos

This project contains a collection of demos for using [DukeScript](https://dukescript.com).
In case you don't know Dukescript yet: It's a framework which allows you to run the same Java application everywhere,
in the Browser, on your desktop, on iOS or Android, or even as a plugin for your IDE.
In the past we've been developing lots of demos to teach the use of the core technology,
show useful tricks and workarounds, or demonstrate how to use the many libraries. 


With this project we've started to collect them and make them available 
from a single place, to make it easier for us to maintain and for you to
find. 

Here are the demos we've collected so far:

- [FXBeanInfo JavaFX Embedded Demo](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/beaninfo-embedded)
- [FXBeanInfo HTML Ui Demo](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/beaninfo-demo)
- [CRUD Application](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/crud)
- [Fifteen Puzzle Game](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/fifteen)
- [Match 3 Game (Candy Crush)](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/match3)
- [Twitter Client](https://github.com/dukescript/dukescript-demos/tree/master/twitter)
